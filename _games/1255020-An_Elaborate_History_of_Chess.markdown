about: In the beginning, there was a pawn. And that pawn said, &quot;Let there be
  wheat!&quot;<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1255020/extras/BuildAKingdom.png?t=1733101982"
  /><br>An Elaborate History of Chess is a blend of real-time and turn-based strategy,
  exploring the history of the popular board game, Chess. Start with just one lowly
  pawn to begin building your village, and work your way up to an entire kingdom.
  Keep your farms running like clockwork to ensure a food supply for your pieces,
  and see how far you can spread your influence.<br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1255020/extras/DefendYourHome.png?t=1733101982"
  /><br>As your kingdom flourishes, you'll attract all sorts of wildlife and monsters
  looking to checkmate your best warriors and take your wheat for themselves. Don't
  forget to build your defences, set up your supply chains, and of course, protect
  the king!<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1255020/extras/ConquerDungeons.png?t=1733101982"
  /><br>When you're feeling brave it's time to turn your attention to the dungeons.
  You'll need to prepare an adventuring party ready to face the horrors and puzzles
  that lie in wait in the time-frozen dungeons, where you'll need to show your mastery
  of chess strategy to overcome the myriad challenges that lie await and steal the
  very best treasures.<br><br>Do you have what it takes to become grandmaster of all
  you see, or will you find your best gambits just don't pay off?
