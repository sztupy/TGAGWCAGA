title: Blocks for Babies
description: Blocks for Babies is a block-stacking boomer shooter where every kill
  shapes the game board. Arrange falling tiles into complete lines, or go in guns
  blazing to clean up the board the messy way. Hard and soft drops aren't your only
  tools anymore—now you have a shotgun.
