You'll need to adapt to the choices offered and enemy compositions. Recruit and dismiss Gods, reroll your options, increase your devotion level to get access to more powerful Gods, and fight Cosmic Horrors in automated battles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2994240/extras/loop_gif_2.gif?t=1730815392\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2994240/extras/all_decisions_matter.png?t=1730815392\" /></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Take synergies and scaling to another level.
