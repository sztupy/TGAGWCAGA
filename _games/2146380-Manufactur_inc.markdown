  lines, <strong>automate</strong> tasks, and <strong>expand</strong> your business
  into new territories. Your ability to balance efficiency, environmental responsibility,
  and employees' happiness will set you apart!<br><br>Compete against others on various
  <strong>leaderboards</strong>! It’s not just about who makes the most money—your
  choices in <i>sustainability</i>, <i>automation</i>, and <i>market adaptation</i>

  class="bb_tag">Developer Notes</h2><br>I am a solo developer working on this game
  primarily during my free time. I genuinely hope you have fun and enjoy this game
  :) Creating this type of game has been a long-standing aspiration of mine, and as
  a significant undertaking, I wanted to familiarize myself with Steam beforehand.  That's
  why I released two other games before. But now, I feel ready to start this adventure!<br><br>We’d
  love to have you join our Discord community, where you can share your thoughts,
  ask questions, and discuss the game with other players. You can find a link in the
