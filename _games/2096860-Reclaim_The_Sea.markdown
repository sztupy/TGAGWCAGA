about: 'Reclaim the Sea is a roguelike strategy and adventure game, set in a steampunk
  fantasy atmosphere. Your goal is to lead your pirate crew through dangerous seas,
  keep your ship in one piece and save the World. Face tough decisions, manage resources,
  spend gold in equipment, upgrades and new crew. You will encounter different ships
  from many factions each time and face tough decisions. Will you be a good pirate
  or reckless buccaneer? Will you defend this civilian ship attacked by thugs? Or
  will you take advantage of its weakened position? If you engage in a fight, you
  will have many options: taking down the enemy crew, burning or sinking their ship,
  staying at long range and playing defensively or engaging at close range… Each run
  is unique thanks to randomly generated ships and maps.<h2 class="bb_tag">Command
  your crew</h2>Order your crew to move in the ship to accomplish all the required
  tasks : charge weapon, pilot the ship, charge the steam overdrive, repair the ship
  and many more.<br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2096860/extras/RTS-command.gif?t=1732610572"
