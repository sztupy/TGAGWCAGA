about: "Become the Guardian of the Abyss and lead the Great Migration to bring forth
  the next Crab God \U0001F980 Use your growing knowledge and great power to command
  your loveable crab babies (Crablings) to restore your ocean domain and protect your
  successor’s egg as you venture into the watery depths.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\"

  /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Grow Your Crabling Colony</h2>Raise your Crablings! Nurture
  their personalities and potential as they worship you, build mighty coral reefs,
  fend off threats, and collect food for the journey ahead. Name them. Upgrade them.
  Grow your unique colony and guide them with your mighty claw as they become the
  next generation of ocean caretakers.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2289390/extras/CrabGod-enviro-GIF2.gif?t=1733735284\"
  /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lead the Great Migration</h2>It is time for a new Crab God
  to rise and protect the oceans and it is your job to lead a successful migration,
  taking your egg to the depths where it can hatch. Balance the growth of your colony
  with the safety of your egg, otherwise, you will need to return to the shallows
  and start the migration anew.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2289390/extras/CrabGod-combat_GIF3.gif?t=1733735284\"
  /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cultivate a Vibrant Underwater Ecosystem</h2>Reintroduce
  a healthy and vibrant diversity back to the ocean, and protect it from predators
  seeking easy prey. Varied sea life will sustain your colony. Unlock new combinations
  of flora and fauna to create a beautiful underwater environment.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\"

  /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Real World Change</h2>Working with dots.eco, your in-game
  progression will help contribute to actual ocean conservation efforts. As you cultivate
  the great reefs of the Crab God, you will also be helping to sustain the beautiful
  world environment that inspires games like ours.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2289390/extras/CustomizationGif1b.gif?t=1733735284\"

  each of your precious Crablings unique by customising their color, accessories,
  tools and more! You can even unlock little fish buddies to keep them company as
  you play."
