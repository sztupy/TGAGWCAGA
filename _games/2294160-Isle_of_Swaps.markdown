about: The worldwide phenomenon of Critters has the world in its grip and the newest
  collectable, the Critter Trading Card Game, has just been released!<br>Dina is Critter
  mad and has been begging her parents for a week to get her some cards. Yesterday
  they relented and have bought her a starter deck and a lovely binder to keep them
  in but it's not enough, she wants all the Critter Cards.<br>It's finally lunch time
  and everyone rushes out to play some more Critter Challenges.<br><br><img class="bb_img"
  src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2294160/extras/Header_BattleGif.gif?t=1733091120"
  /><br>It's Critter Combat! Build up energy with weaker Skill cards and spend it
  to play stronger cards. With each Critter having varied stats, abilities, Weakness
  and Resistances, making a varied team is key. You don't want your whole team to
  be weak to Blaze attacks do you?<br>But Skill cards can only be used by Critters
  of the same element, so maybe using multiple Critters of the same type is a good
  strategy? You wouldn't want your Aqua Critter to be defeated and then not be able
  to use your Aqua Skill Cards.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2294160/extras/Header_DeckbuildingGif.gif?t=1733091120"
  /><br>Build your deck by swapping with the characters you beat in battle. Got some
  doubles? Swap as many times as you like and are able, no limits here. Any cards
  are added to your binder to change up your Battle Deck at any time. Equip Stickers
  for passive bonuses but be aware that using rarer Critters limits how many Stickers
  you can use. Balance your deck between Critters, Skills and Stickers to claim victory!<br><br><br><img
  class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2294160/extras/Header_ChallengesGif.gif?t=1733091120"
  /><br>Proceed through Challenges by picking one of 3 map cards but if you're feeling
  brave, unflipped cards award money that can be used to buy Booster Packs. A victory
  in a Challenge adds the cards in your battle deck to your permanent Master Binder,
  letting you customise the starting Critter in future runs. Create decks from the
  Master Binder to take on the Critter Championship and put your deckbuilding to the
  test. And the next Challenge run? Totally different. With 6 different areas that
  can appear in any order, you never know what you'll run into next time.<h2 class="bb_tag">Game
  Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A number of artists have illustrated hundreds
  of cards to collect and store lovingly in your binder<br></li><li>A whole bunch
  of Skill cards and passive ability Stickers to come up with an array of strategies.<br></li><li>Swap
  with characters you beat to build your deck instead of 'pick 1 of 3 cards'. Swap
  those dupes!<br></li><li>Each run is made up from 3 of the 6 Areas and can be played
  in any order, doing acts in the same order is pretty boring, right?<br></li><li>Collect
  cards between runs in the Master Binder and use Master Decks to take on the toughest
  fights in the Critter Championship.</li></ul><br>This is a game inspired by a single
  dev's experience of when the pokemon trading card game took over school playgrounds,
  swapping every breaktime and having illustrated cardboard consume his life.
