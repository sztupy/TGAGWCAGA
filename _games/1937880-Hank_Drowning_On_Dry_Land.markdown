title: 'Hank: Drowning On Dry Land'
description: The time-traveling vigilante Hank thought he was going for a nice drink,
  only to find himself poisoned! Paralyzed, he lies on the floor, drowning in a puddle
  of spilled beer. As his brain withers away, the hero embarks on a journey through
  his own subconscious.
