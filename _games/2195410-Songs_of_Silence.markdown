reviews: "“Songs Of Silence is probably the most gorgeous auto battler I've ever played.
  Except that's doing it a misservice, because it's a lot more than an auto battler.
  It's a curious mix of genres - part Battle For Wesnoth, part Songs Of Conquest,
  part Clash Of Clans. And all wrapped up with some wonderful presentation, music,
  and a minimalist but competently voice-acted story which swept me into its world
  almost immediately.”<br>RockPaperShotgun<br><br>“Songs of Silence is repainting
  the strategy genre in gorgeous technicolor. You can forget the staid, drab medieval
  fantasy of many other strategies, and revel instead in the excesses and bold brushstrokes
  that the team at Chimera Entertainment have crafted.”<br>The Sixth Axis<br><br>“Songs
  of Silence will offer an exciting fantasy world with lots of interesting facets
  to it. All of this is rendered in stunning illustrations that I wanted to stare
  at for much longer than I was allowed to in this session.”<br>GameLuster<br>"
