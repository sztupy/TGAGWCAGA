  in the world of dreams. You play the role of the Sandman, whose goal is to rescue
  children from the trap of their own nightmares. As you progress through the game,
  you will discover more about each child and the nature of their fears. The items
  found on each level will appear in the child''s room, making the experience more
  personal. In addition to the child''s fears, you will also face the god of nightmares,
  Morpheus, who has a personal motivation to prevent the children from waking up.</p><p

  class="bb_paragraph">Immerse yourself in the magical world of childhood nightmares.
  45 levels, divided into 3 chapters, filled with challenges and atmospheric locations,
  assembled and detailed by hand, are waiting for you. Every child''s dream is a unique
  universe. Don''t let kids get stuck in dreams, help them overcome their fears!</p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph">Learn how to combine Sandman''s unique abilities, such as changing
  in size to slip through tight spaces that others cannot. But the only way to really
  discover the ability is to study how the mechanics of the surrounding world react
  to its use;</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Pick up a flask containing magical
  sand and place it wherever you want. This will allow you to resurrect three times
  at that location, preventing you from starting the level from the beginning after
  each death (and there will be many of them);</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Interact
  with the environment. A lot of mechanics are designed to push the player to use
  already familiar abilities in new ways, changing the gameplay and forcing them to
  experiment;</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Find secrets! The nightmare world
  is filled with mysteries, and the destruction of obstacles will allow you to access
  shortcuts that simplify (and sometimes complicate) the passage of the level;</p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph">Listen to the rhythm to choose the proper timing. Most of the
  environmental mechanics in Through the Nightmares work in time with the music’s
  beats, so all you need to do is let the rhythm guide you.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><h2

  children from the trap of their own nightmares. As you progress through the game,
  you will discover more about each child and the nature of their fears. The items
  found on each level will appear in the child''s room, making the experience more
  personal. In addition to the child''s fears, you will also face the god of nightmares,
  Morpheus, who has a personal motivation to prevent the children from waking up.</p><p

  class="bb_paragraph">Immerse yourself in the magical world of childhood nightmares.
  45 levels, divided into 3 chapters, filled with challenges and atmospheric locations,
  assembled and detailed by hand, are waiting for you. Every child''s dream is a unique
  universe. Don''t let kids get stuck in dreams, help them overcome their fears!</p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph">Learn how to combine Sandman''s unique abilities, such as changing
  in size to slip through tight spaces that others cannot. But the only way to really
  discover the ability is to study how the mechanics of the surrounding world react
  to its use;</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Pick up a flask containing magical
  sand and place it wherever you want. This will allow you to resurrect three times
  at that location, preventing you from starting the level from the beginning after
  each death (and there will be many of them);</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Interact
  with the environment. A lot of mechanics are designed to push the player to use
  already familiar abilities in new ways, changing the gameplay and forcing them to
  experiment;</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Find secrets! The nightmare world
  is filled with mysteries, and the destruction of obstacles will allow you to access
  shortcuts that simplify (and sometimes complicate) the passage of the level;</p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph">Listen to the rhythm to choose the proper timing. Most of the
  environmental mechanics in Through the Nightmares work in time with the music’s
  beats, so all you need to do is let the rhythm guide you.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><h2
