The dreams of each child are atmospheric locations with unique setting, manually filled with a large number of details. All dreams are different, just as the children are: everyone has their own hobbies, impressions, and fears.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1266210/extras/7_room.png?t=1732121206\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You have to stay overnight in a gloomy forest, explore the depths of space, and visit the era of knights.

You play the role of the Sandman, whose goal is to rescue children from the trap of their own nightmares. As you progress through the game, you will discover more about each child and the nature of their fears. The items found on each level will appear in the child's room, making the experience more personal. In addition to the child's fears, you will also face the god of nightmares, Morpheus, who has a personal motivation to prevent the children from waking up.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1266210/extras/10_cutscenes.png?t=1732121206\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1266210/extras/hr.png?t=1732121206\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MAIN FEATURES</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Immerse yourself in the magical world of childhood nightmares. 45 levels, divided into 3 chapters, filled with challenges and atmospheric locations, assembled and detailed by hand, are waiting for you. Every child's dream is a unique universe. Don't let kids get stuck in dreams, help them overcome their fears!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Learn how to combine Sandman's unique abilities, such as changing in size to slip through tight spaces that others cannot. But the only way to really discover the ability is to study how the mechanics of the surrounding world react to its use;</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Pick up a flask containing magical sand and place it wherever you want. This will allow you to resurrect three times at that location, preventing you from starting the level from the beginning after each death (and there will be many of them);</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Interact with the environment. A lot of mechanics are designed to push the player to use already familiar abilities in new ways, changing the gameplay and forcing them to experiment;</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Find secrets! The nightmare world is filled with mysteries, and the destruction of obstacles will allow you to access shortcuts that simplify (and sometimes complicate) the passage of the level;</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Listen to the rhythm to choose the proper timing. Most of the environmental mechanics in Through the Nightmares work in time with the music’s beats, so all you need to do is let the rhythm guide you.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Don't forget to wishlist the game! ✅</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1266210/extras/Wishlist.gif?t=1732121206\" /></p>"

As you progress through the game, you will discover more about each child and the nature of their fears. The items found on each level will appear in the child's room, making the experience more personal. In addition to the child's fears, you will also face the god of nightmares, Morpheus, who has a personal motivation to prevent the children from waking up.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1266210/extras/10_cutscenes.png?t=1732121206\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1266210/extras/hr.png?t=1732121206\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MAIN FEATURES</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Immerse yourself in the magical world of childhood nightmares. 45 levels, divided into 3 chapters, filled with challenges and atmospheric locations, assembled and detailed by hand, are waiting for you. Every child's dream is a unique universe. Don't let kids get stuck in dreams, help them overcome their fears!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Learn how to combine Sandman's unique abilities, such as changing in size to slip through tight spaces that others cannot. But the only way to really discover the ability is to study how the mechanics of the surrounding world react to its use;</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Pick up a flask containing magical sand and place it wherever you want. This will allow you to resurrect three times at that location, preventing you from starting the level from the beginning after each death (and there will be many of them);</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Interact with the environment. A lot of mechanics are designed to push the player to use already familiar abilities in new ways, changing the gameplay and forcing them to experiment;</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Find secrets! The nightmare world is filled with mysteries, and the destruction of obstacles will allow you to access shortcuts that simplify (and sometimes complicate) the passage of the level;</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Listen to the rhythm to choose the proper timing. Most of the environmental mechanics in Through the Nightmares work in time with the music’s beats, so all you need to do is let the rhythm guide you.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Don't forget to wishlist the game! ✅</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1266210/extras/Wishlist.gif?t=1732121206\" /></p>"
