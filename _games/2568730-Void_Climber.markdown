about: <p class="bb_paragraph">Climb to the top of a collapsing universe in this parkour
  platformer with roguelike elements. As an interstellar scout, you are sent to probe
  a cosmic anomaly that has left the world shattered and chaotic. Space fractures,
  time crumbles, and fragments of a broken world—eroded rocks, rusted machinery, ancient
  ruins—drift together in a strange, unstable mix. Past and future blur. With each
  failed attempt to escape, the realm shifts and reassembles. Navigate this ever-changing
  landscape, where every fall sends you back to the beginning. Conquer the void as
  fast as you can before it consumes everything. </p><h2 class="bb_tag">Master Merciless
