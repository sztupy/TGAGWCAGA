description: You are the lone survivor orbiting a potential new home planet, tethered
  to whatâ€™s left of your ship. Gather nearby debris and assemble a make-shift vessel
  in an attempt to survive the harsh realities of space. Maybe you'll live long enough
  to uncover the truth behind the ship's malfunction...
