title: Nothing Beyond This Point
description: In the Void, everyone is alone, and you're no exception. Use your health
  as damage, create your own character with abilities and Sigils, and fight through
  corrupted souls in this top-down action Metroidvania. Don't be fooled - you're nobody's
  last hope.
