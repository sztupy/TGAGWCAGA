reviews: "“Of all the games to tread in the wake of Dark Souls and Elden Ring, new indie soulslike game Void Sols might be one of the most distinctive and exciting.”<br>PCGamesN<br><br>“Void Sols brings a really experimental spirit to the soulslike genre.”<br>PC Gamer<br><br>“With its novel use of lighting, Void Sols distills the essence of Souls games into something minimalist and pure, but just as frightening. Perhaps the dawn of the Sols-like is upon us.”<br>Eurogamer<br>"
