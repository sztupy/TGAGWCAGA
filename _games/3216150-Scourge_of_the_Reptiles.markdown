title: Scourge of the Reptiles
description: Scourge of the Reptiles is a party-based tactical RPG set in a prehistoric
  fantasy world. When a meteor strikes the Earth, humans, elves and dinosaurs alike
  are gifted with magical abilities—abilities that result in war, devastation and
  forces that stretch far beyond the hero’s quiet home village.
