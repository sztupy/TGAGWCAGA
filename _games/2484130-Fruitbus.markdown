reviews: "“When I hopped into Fruitbus for the first time, I expected a typical food
  van management game, akin to the hundreds you can play on mobile. I couldn’t have
  been more wrong! Fruitbus has great gameplay, an island rich with stories and interesting
  locations, and a wholesome, albeit moving storyline, which makes the game so much
  more than simply serving fruit.”<br>Overclockers UK<br><br>“Fruitbus is the perfect
  addition to any cozy gamer’s library with a lovely atmosphere, welcoming graphics
  and adorable characters lining the story. I have sunk so many hours into this game
  and I plan to keep playing it!”<br>Thumb Culture<br><br>“Graphics are beautiful,
  the game is full of soul and just as sweet as norwegian strawberrys used to be.”<br>Gamer
