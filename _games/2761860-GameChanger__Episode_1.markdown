about: '<h2 class="bb_tag">Break the cycle of eternal failure!</h2><br>The Interworld
  has been in a state of rigidity for ages. The collective intelligence of the great
  portals and the constant presence of their servants force the inhabitants to never
  leave their world. But the <i>Raid</i> program stubbornly follows its creator''s
  plan. With the help of a recurring virus, he wants to try to close all portals and
  defeat the <i>Never-ending Dragon</i> in order to fulfill his task and enable a
  way out of the Interworld.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2761860/extras/gcgif1.gif?t=1723021485"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">Explore the Interworld!</h2><br>GameChanger is a 2D action-adventure
  game with shoot ''em up combat and puzzle elements. As the liberator of the Interworld,
  you take on the role of the virus led by Raid. The virus moves around floating and
  can use projectiles to defeat enemies, activate switches and much more. After a
  linear starting area, a small but nice open world awaits you, in which three dungeons
  can be found and completed in any order in order to face the dragon. Away from the
  dungeons, there are many optional upgrades to be found in the world that can be
  earned through puzzle solving, mini-games, battle arenas, and other activities.
  By obtaining all upgrades, you will not only make the main journey easier, but also
  learn more about the <i>Interworld</i> and the story of Raid!<br><br><img class="bb_img"
  src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2761860/extras/gcgif2.gif?t=1723021485"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">Solve puzzles with skill and precision!</h2><br>The puzzle
  solving is based on switch puzzles, physics puzzles, agility games and similar elements.
  All of this is realized via the virus''s shooting mechanics. Some puzzles, especially
  early on, are isolated to one area, but later in the complex dungeons you''ll notice
  that they can be viewed as one big puzzle box where different rooms can influence
  each other. With GameChanger''s dungeons we want to capture the classic &quot;dungeon
  feeling&quot; from older action adventures and at the same time enrich it with our
  own innovations. You have to find out for yourself what awaits you in the dungeons
  beyond the puzzles!<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2761860/extras/gcgif3.gif?t=1723021485"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">Defend yourself against the counter viruses!</h2><br>The counter
  viruses created by the great portals are part of the enemy''s collective intelligence
  and will try to stop Raid and you from completing your task. The same projectiles
  you use for puzzles are also used to defend against counter viruses. They appear
  all over the world in different forms and challenge your precision and your ability
  to react. Sometimes you will even have to compete in battle arenas against smaller
  portals with large numbers of counter viruses. Raid is sure you have what it takes,
  even if he doesn''t like to admit it!<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2761860/extras/gcgif4.gif?t=1723021485"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">What are you waiting for?</h2><br>Whether in the depths of
  the dungeons, in the mysterious Interworld or even in the lively little community
  of tamed counter viruses: adventures await you everywhere in the world of GameChanger!
  Sometimes you have to show skill, sometimes you have to stop and think and sometimes
  you have to shoot wildly at everything that moves. Whichever path you choose, new
  challenges will await you throughout GameChanger until you''re finally ready to
  take on the dragon. A single iteration of the virus before you ever managed to even
  reach the dragon, and that encounter had devastating consequences from which neither
  the Interworld nor Raid have ever fully recovered. Show them you can do it this
  time!<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2761860/extras/gcgif5.gif?t=1723021485"
