  notes: "Some stylized nudity, which is artistic and non-explicit, may be present.
    Additionally, it features mild violence, which is integral to the storytelling
    but kept within the bounds of the game's thematic context.\r\n\r\nPlayers should
    be aware that the narrative delves into themes of anxiety, obsession, and mental
    decay, which may be intense for some audiences. The story may include dramatic
    or unsettling scenes to enhance the atmospheric experience."

  in the 90s, in a gritty and decaying urban setting, a single gunshot shatters the
  silence. You''re no hero, just a mundane janitor battling anxiety and obsession.
  Tonight, a final task before clocking out spirals into a pulp mystery, pushing your
  sanity to its limits. As you navigate this morally bankrupt world, your deteriorating
  mental state becomes your greatest enemy, in this peculiar tale about obsession,
  as your fate collides with the aftermath of that fateful gunshot.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p
  class="bb_paragraph">Brace yourself for a psychological odyssey focused on a character
  study, with a deep dive into the troubled mind of an ordinary person, slowly unveiling
  hopes, dreams, and desires. This cinematic narrative blends raw intensity of classic
  horror films with the weird charm of B-movies. As you approach the end, the boundaries
  of sanity will blur.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Are

  /></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><strong>GAME AND CINEMATIC INFLUENCES</strong></p><p
  class="bb_paragraph">Gloomy Juncture was born from a blend of personal experiences
  and love for psychological thrillers with a desire to explore complex human themes.
  As a ''90s kid from a challenging background, I’ve always been drawn to gritty,
  dystopian settings and flawed characters.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This
  is a deeply personal project, with a lot of myself exposed in an exaggerated and
  pulp dressing and an atmosphere that embodies a dark expression of fatalism and
  hopelessness, the overall setting is inspired by neo-noir films and psychological
  dramas such as Hitchcock''s Vertigo, Park''s Oldboy and Scorsese''s Taxi Driver.
  For the visuals and pacing of the story, I''ve drawn a lot from movies like Argento''s
  Suspiria, Lynch''s Blue Velvet and Aronofsky''s Requiem for a Dream.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p
  class="bb_paragraph">The setting may sound nihilistic but, at its core, Gloomy Juncture
  leans into common issues and I''m trying to explore themes of mental health, obsession,
  violence, guilt and human struggles.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For
  gameplay, I want to recreate the experience of getting lost in a classic graphic
  adventure yearning to see &quot;what''s next&quot;. Games like Grim Fandango and
  Broken Sword were key inspirations for the core mechanics, while titles such as
  Tomb Raider (1996) and Hotel Dusk: Room 215 influenced the puzzle-solving. The gritty,
  noir atmosphere, on the other hand, is inspired from games like Max Payne and The
  Wolf Among Us.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Setting the
  game in the ''90s felt natural, aligning both with the classic adventure gameplay
  I''m evoking and the visual style inspired by early 3D and N64-era. By hand-drawing
  the world on paper, Gloomy Juncture creates a distinctive aesthetic that''s both
  nostalgic and fresh, resulting in a unique visual experience.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p
  class="bb_paragraph">Prepare to step into an unsettling world with fragments of
  a feverish dream driven by obsession.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img
  class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839980/extras/GIF_Steam_Key-Gameplay-min.gif?t=1732762840"
  /></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><strong>PULL LEVERS, PUSH BUTTONS, AND SOLVE ENVIRONMENTAL
  ENIGMAS</strong></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The core gameplay revolves around gathering
  items, interacting with the environment, and solving increasingly complex puzzles
  that evolve in scale and complexity as the narrative progresses.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p
  class="bb_paragraph">Gloomy Juncture features a variety of unique puzzle types:</p><ul
  class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"> Traditional up-close logic challenges</p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph"> Large-scale environmental puzzles requiring careful observation</p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph"> Dynamic events and feverish dream sequences</p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph"> Action-packed puzzles demanding both brains and brawn</p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph"> ''Boss'' puzzle encounters with real-time pattern recognition</p></li></ul><p
  class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">There''s no repetition in puzzle
  design; each one is unique, keeping you engaged and challenged throughout your journey.
  Creatively use items to distract and confuse NPCs, or uncover alternative solutions
  to puzzles with hidden items scattered throughout the world.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p
  class="bb_paragraph">The player character will also react to your actions in real-time;
  this ''noirish'' dynamic narration enriches the experience and provides minimal
  diegetic tips—your only help for the journey.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p
  class="bb_paragraph">Expect challenging puzzles seamlessly blending exploration,
  problem-solving and immersive storytelling.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img

  sanity to its limits. As you navigate this morally bankrupt world, your deteriorating
  mental state becomes your greatest enemy, in this peculiar tale about obsession,

  class="bb_paragraph">Gloomy Juncture was born from a blend of personal experiences
  and love for psychological thrillers with a desire to explore complex human themes.
  As a ''90s kid from a challenging background, I’ve always been drawn to gritty,
  dystopian settings and flawed characters.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This
  is a deeply personal project, with a lot of myself exposed in an exaggerated and
  pulp dressing and an atmosphere that embodies a dark expression of fatalism and
  hopelessness, the overall setting is inspired by neo-noir films and psychological
  dramas such as Hitchcock''s Vertigo, Park''s Oldboy and Scorsese''s Taxi Driver.
  For the visuals and pacing of the story, I''ve drawn a lot from movies like Argento''s
  Suspiria, Lynch''s Blue Velvet and Aronofsky''s Requiem for a Dream.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p
  class="bb_paragraph">The setting may sound nihilistic but, at its core, Gloomy Juncture
  leans into common issues and I''m trying to explore themes of mental health, obsession,
  violence, guilt and human struggles.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For
  gameplay, I want to recreate the experience of getting lost in a classic graphic
  adventure yearning to see &quot;what''s next&quot;. Games like Grim Fandango and
  Broken Sword were key inspirations for the core mechanics, while titles such as
  Tomb Raider (1996) and Hotel Dusk: Room 215 influenced the puzzle-solving. The gritty,
  noir atmosphere, on the other hand, is inspired from games like Max Payne and The
  Wolf Among Us.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Setting the
  game in the ''90s felt natural, aligning both with the classic adventure gameplay
  I''m evoking and the visual style inspired by early 3D and N64-era. By hand-drawing
  the world on paper, Gloomy Juncture creates a distinctive aesthetic that''s both
  nostalgic and fresh, resulting in a unique visual experience.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p
  class="bb_paragraph">Prepare to step into an unsettling world with fragments of
  a feverish dream driven by obsession.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img

  /></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><strong>PULL LEVERS, PUSH BUTTONS, AND SOLVE ENVIRONMENTAL
  ENIGMAS</strong></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The core gameplay revolves around gathering
  items, interacting with the environment, and solving increasingly complex puzzles
  that evolve in scale and complexity as the narrative progresses.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p
  class="bb_paragraph">Gloomy Juncture features a variety of unique puzzle types:</p><ul
  class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"> Traditional up-close logic challenges</p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph"> Large-scale environmental puzzles requiring careful observation</p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph"> Dynamic events and feverish dream sequences</p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph"> Action-packed puzzles demanding both brains and brawn</p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph"> ''Boss'' puzzle encounters with real-time pattern recognition</p></li></ul><p
  class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">There''s no repetition in puzzle
  design; each one is unique, keeping you engaged and challenged throughout your journey.
  Creatively use items to distract and confuse NPCs, or uncover alternative solutions
  to puzzles with hidden items scattered throughout the world.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p
  class="bb_paragraph">The player character will also react to your actions in real-time;
  this ''noirish'' dynamic narration enriches the experience and provides minimal
  diegetic tips—your only help for the journey.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p
  class="bb_paragraph">Expect challenging puzzles seamlessly blending exploration,
  problem-solving and immersive storytelling.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img

reviews: "“A puzzle game in a chaotic world that calls in for your sanity. Solving
  puzzles is about restoring order. However, in this work, the paradoxical puzzle
  feeling of being drawn deeper into a person's world of madness the more puzzles
  you solve is very appealing. Furthermore, the fact that it is done by a single developer
  drawing for the first time and using those drawings directly into the game brings
  a new shake-up to the somewhat stagnating indie game world, making it the most controversial
  work in the history of BitSummit, depicting a fascinating decadence with a sort
  of outsider art feel.”<br>Professor Iida Kazutoshi, Game Designer from Ritsumeikan
  University @ BitSummit Drift 2024<br><br>“It's an incredibly cool art style, isn't
  it? All the textures are done by a single person. The development company consists
  of one guy and one cat, making a new type of point &amp; click in the first person.
  This is a mystery game set in a noir world with a unique style, where you experience
  the inside of someone’s mental state.”<br>Swery (Hidetaka Suehiro) - Top 5 Favorite
  Games @ BitSummit Drift 2024<br>"
