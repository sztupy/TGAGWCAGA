But first you'll have to learn how to properly take care of the unknown Earthly vegetation species, and how to make the best use of them. As your adventure unfolds, you'll also meet Neanderthals, and will have to learn to communicate to earn their trust. At least air is clean and pristine in the prehistoric times, but as you do not breathe oxygen, you'll have to figure out how to fulfill respiratory needs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>KEY FEATURES OF ASTROBOTANICA™</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2720920/extras/growing_opt1.gif?t=1732438425\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Cultivate barren soil.</strong> Mix muck and mire with compost, mark out plant beds, supply water, and protect your breeding from hungry birds and nosy rodents.<br></li><li><strong>Secure supplies of crucial carbon dioxide.</strong> Figure out and secure the supply of CO2 derived from plants, required for your alien breathing.<br></li><li><strong>Customize your character and surroundings.</strong> Eventually, make yourself at home.
