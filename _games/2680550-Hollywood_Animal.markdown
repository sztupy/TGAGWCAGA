title: Hollywood Animal
description: Make your dreams come true — or crush someone else’s. Take the helm of
  a major Hollywood studio at the dawn of sound cinema, and guide it through decades
  of creative achievements and glamor, debauchery and dark deeds, tough choices and
  unpleasant compromises.
