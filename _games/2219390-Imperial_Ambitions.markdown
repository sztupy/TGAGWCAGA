  />Imperial Ambitions has a completely new strategy game design providing a unique
  4X gameplay experience. Anyone who enjoys the Napoleonic wars will find the tactical
  thinking required for Imperial Ambitions to be much more rewarding. As you forge
  an empire, the battlefields will become more challenging. We've redesigned the way
  that armies move on a campaign map, so they act more like real-world military units.
  Large armies can move in column formation, making it harder to move and requires
  more tactical thinking to prepare for the battle. The regiments can be split from
  the main army for small tactical excursions, or sneak into enemy lines for crossfire.
  For the same reason, attention is required to avoid leaving gaps on your frontline.<br><br><img
  class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/Landing_in_IA_01.gif?t=1731847278"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">Social Classes</h2><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/artisan.png?t=1731847278"
  />The society in the game is divided into classes, slaves, peasants, apprentices,
  artisans and masters. Besides slaves, the citizens will be allowed to progress through
  four tiers of classes, with each step providing increased capabilities, but also
  requiring different resources from you. The education is the key for most of your
  citizens to climb this social ladder. Higher classes will provide exponentially
  more labor, but will also require unique luxury resources. The citizens may stop
  working for several reasons, such as training, hunger, epidemic, strike, accidents,
  criminal activities, exhaustion, rebellion or retirement. While higher classes are
  often preferable, they are also harder to maintain due to requirement of luxury.
  The units and agents are also required to be trained from respective classes. For
  that reason, the players need to find the optimal balance between these classes.<br><br><img
  class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/Sociates_02.png?t=1731847278"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">Production Chains</h2><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/engineer.png?t=1731847278"
  />Your Empire will grow beyond the mountains and the seas. As it grows you will
  have access to more and endemic resources. The more you invest into your roads and
  docks, the more resources that produced around the corners of your empire will be
  transported into your capital. With abundance in your capital, you can allocate
  your laborers to produce to higher quality goods. Imperial Ambitions has more than
  40 different resources that can be extracted, produced or imported. Your population
  will demand products depending on their level of education. You must manage your
  resources and customize your production chains, while ensuring the wellbeing of
  your population. Some key resources may just not be accessible to you. You can resolve
  either by leasing the land from the natives, military invasion, trading with superpowers,
  or exploiting black market.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/gentleman_animations.gif?t=1731847278"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">Black Market And Trade</h2><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/merchant.png?t=1731847278"
  />For the savvy entrepreneur and economist, the black market is a huge opportunity
  to boost your own empire. No longer do you have to go through the tedious and sometimes
  costly process of building a colony and maintain an industry. the game will include
  a black market besides the regular market. In regular trade, a player can initiate
  a bid for something they need and, if another player sells it to them, everyone
  is happy! Though, this trade is also taxed by any country that has lands en route.
  Black market, however works completely different. The resources in the black market
  is pulled from towns with high corruption. And players can bid for these resources,
  even if they belong to their enemies. The cost, however, is often higher than normal,
  yet no one can tax. This can be a boon for some players in need of certain products
  that are capitalised by their enemies and for everyone that prefers not to pay taxes.
  Instead, however, corruption and criminal activity will become more prevalent among
  the towns along the route. e careful not to get caught in a cycle of corruption
  and crime! To promote corruption player can send man of shadows to start a crime
  syndicate. It however requires opium to initiate (also only available at black market)
  However, the player is not defenseless. Players can use the man of shadow to start
  intelligence mission, to eradicate crime syndicates.<br><br><img class="bb_img"
  src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/tradeUI.png?t=1731847278"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">Undisclosed Tech Tree</h2><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/spy.png?t=1731847278"
  />In our opinion, it is unrealistic for the players to be able to view the tech
  tree. In Imperial Ambitions, the player will only be shown the available techs they
  can fund without disclosing the whole tree. It makes the game more challenging and
  exciting. This is also part of the discovery experience in Imperial Ambitions -
  you learn by doing! Funding a tech is not enough for research. The player must have
  one of their gentlemen agent perform an action related to that technology to be
  able to discover it. This action is also not revealed to the player. Thus player
  has to make a guess to what actions would help discover that tech. For example,
  a gentlemen has to sail the ocean to be able to discover the &quot;Sextant&quot;,
  a navigation tool for sailors. Or, to discover &quot;Abolishment of slavery&quot;
  the player need to actually working slaves.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/Industry_in_IA_01-2-2.gif?t=1731847278"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">Diplomacy</h2><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/diplomat.png?t=1731847278"
  />We envision a simple diplomacy for Imperial Ambitions. The difference in IA from
  most 4X, is that an agent has to be sent to the opponent's capital or party in an
  effort to ceasefire, establish trade relations, embassies, defensive pacts and alliances.
  Once an embassy or trade consulate is established the agent is dismissed. On the
  other hand, cancelling an existing agreement can simply be performed from the diplomacy
  window. It takes days to build bridges but seconds to destroy them.<br><br><img

  />We chose a pixelated art style for the game since it’s a fun and approachable
  way to communicate controversial events of our recent history such as post-colonial
  subversion. We also wanted a retro aesthetic design to assist players in imagining
  this alternate universe, mixing pop culture with classic cartoon representations
  of imperialism.

  have access to more and endemic resources. The more you invest into your roads and
  docks, the more resources that produced around the corners of your empire will be
  transported into your capital. With abundance in your capital, you can allocate
  your laborers to produce to higher quality goods. Imperial Ambitions has more than
  40 different resources that can be extracted, produced or imported. Your population
  will demand products depending on their level of education. You must manage your
  resources and customize your production chains, while ensuring the wellbeing of
  your population. Some key resources may just not be accessible to you. You can resolve
  either by leasing the land from the natives, military invasion, trading with superpowers,
  or exploiting black market.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/gentleman_animations.gif?t=1731847278"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">Black Market And Trade</h2><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/merchant.png?t=1731847278"
  />For the savvy entrepreneur and economist, the black market is a huge opportunity
  to boost your own empire. No longer do you have to go through the tedious and sometimes
  costly process of building a colony and maintain an industry. the game will include
  a black market besides the regular market. In regular trade, a player can initiate
  a bid for something they need and, if another player sells it to them, everyone
  is happy! Though, this trade is also taxed by any country that has lands en route.
  Black market, however works completely different. The resources in the black market
  is pulled from towns with high corruption. And players can bid for these resources,
  even if they belong to their enemies. The cost, however, is often higher than normal,
  yet no one can tax. This can be a boon for some players in need of certain products
  that are capitalised by their enemies and for everyone that prefers not to pay taxes.
  Instead, however, corruption and criminal activity will become more prevalent among
  the towns along the route. e careful not to get caught in a cycle of corruption
  and crime! To promote corruption player can send man of shadows to start a crime
  syndicate. It however requires opium to initiate (also only available at black market)
  However, the player is not defenseless. Players can use the man of shadow to start
  intelligence mission, to eradicate crime syndicates.<br><br><img class="bb_img"

  /><h2 class="bb_tag">Undisclosed Tech Tree</h2><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/spy.png?t=1731847278"
  />In our opinion, it is unrealistic for the players to be able to view the tech
  tree. In Imperial Ambitions, the player will only be shown the available techs they
  can fund without disclosing the whole tree. It makes the game more challenging and
  exciting. This is also part of the discovery experience in Imperial Ambitions -
  you learn by doing! Funding a tech is not enough for research. The player must have
  one of their gentlemen agent perform an action related to that technology to be
  able to discover it. This action is also not revealed to the player. Thus player
  has to make a guess to what actions would help discover that tech. For example,
  a gentlemen has to sail the ocean to be able to discover the &quot;Sextant&quot;,
  a navigation tool for sailors. Or, to discover &quot;Abolishment of slavery&quot;
  the player need to actually working slaves.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/Industry_in_IA_01-2-2.gif?t=1731847278"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">Diplomacy</h2><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/diplomat.png?t=1731847278"
  />We envision a simple diplomacy for Imperial Ambitions. The difference in IA from
  most 4X, is that an agent has to be sent to the opponent's capital or party in an
  effort to ceasefire, establish trade relations, embassies, defensive pacts and alliances.
  Once an embassy or trade consulate is established the agent is dismissed. On the
  other hand, cancelling an existing agreement can simply be performed from the diplomacy
  window. It takes days to build bridges but seconds to destroy them.<br><br><img

  />We chose a pixelated art style for the game since it’s a fun and approachable
  way to communicate controversial events of our recent history such as post-colonial
  subversion. We also wanted a retro aesthetic design to assist players in imagining
  this alternate universe, mixing pop culture with classic cartoon representations
  of imperialism.
