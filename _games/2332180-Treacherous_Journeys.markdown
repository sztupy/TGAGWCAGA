about: <h2 class="bb_tag">Welcome to Thile!</h2><p class="bb_paragraph">You are an
  adventurer, aspiring to become a Cairn Keeper of The Wanderers' Circle, an ancient
  order established to keep the trails safe.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">With
  the order in decline since the rise of kingdoms and the protective cairns neglected
  for generations, there is enough to do for a Cairn Keeper! Animals and various hostile
  beings are encroaching on human land, and once forgotten fears are again becoming
  very real.     </p><h2 class="bb_tag">A Shared World</h2><p class="bb_paragraph">You
  might come across many other players as you fight your way through the shared world.
  But Treacherous Journeys caters to smaller parties as well as lone wolves, rather
  than raid groups.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">A central campaign, manageable even
  to individuals, ties everything together; still there will be plenty of opportunities
  to stray off the beaten path and experience your own adventure! To support this,
  certain locations such as dungeons are instanced for a more intimate and immersive
  experience.   </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Thile needs
  wanderers now more than ever before. When you think you have seen it all there will
  be plenty more, with an endgame that lets you seek out challenges whereever they
  might appear in the world!  </p><h2 class="bb_tag">Character Customization</h2><p
  class="bb_paragraph">Create, customize, and equip your adventurer. Increase your
  reknown within the Wanderers' Circle to gain the trust of masters, learn powerful
  skills and even choose masteries of your own!</p><h2 class="bb_tag">Action Combat</h2><p
  class="bb_paragraph">Say goodbye to tab-targeting. Engage in real-time action combat
  that relies on your own skills and reflexes. Hunt for rare loot and trade freely
  with other players. Party up with nearby characters and form or join clans.</p><h2
  class="bb_tag">Freedom to Choose</h2><p class="bb_paragraph">On release you will
  not be bound by a single realm, but will be able to play with friends from all over
  the world. The game currently has North American and European servers - with other
  locations possibly to come.   </p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i><strong>Embark on your
  journey now! </strong></i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p
