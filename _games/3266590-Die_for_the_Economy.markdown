title: Die for the Economy!
description: Blast evil robots in a retro psychedelic maze of an office, as you bring
  down the security servers and make your way home. Die for the Economy! is a retro
  arcade survival game featuring beautiful, chunky pixel art graphics with a psychedelic
  slant harking back to the old 8-bit game systems.
