  you for the overwhelming support on SEDAP!''s demo. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">It
  has come to our attention that players are facing some issues with playing using
  a controller. <i>SEDAP!</i> does not currently have full built-in support for all
  controllers. <strong>However, Steam Input is supported.</strong>  </p><p class="bb_paragraph"><u><strong>Steps:</strong></u><br>1.
  Enable controller configuration support for compatible controllers: </p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph">   a. Open Steam and navigate to the controller settings page
  (Steam Settings &gt; Controller).</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><img class="bb_img"

  /></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">   b. Enable the proper configuration
  support based on the controller by toggling the respective options.</p></li></ul><p

  /></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Steam should now detect the controller and allow it
  to use Steam Input features.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><strong>2. Overriding game
  properties</strong></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">   a. On &quot;Sedap
  Demo&quot; in your Library, click the gear button on the right, select ''Properties...''.</p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph">   b. Go to Controller and select ''Enable Steam Input'' for
  Override for Sedap Demo (Changing requires restart of the game).</p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph">   c. You may open the Controller Configurator to see more
  details or remap your controller. </p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph">We appreciate
  everyone''s feedback so far and will be handling bugfixes and improvements to the
  demo as soon as we can! </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><strong>Thank
