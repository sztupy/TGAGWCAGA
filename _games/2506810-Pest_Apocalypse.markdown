reviews: "“What you get here is a quality mixture of mechanics. The repeated runs
  of building up a crazy combination of weapons and abilities popularized by Vampire
  Survivors, but with the spin on it that you're in a fast-moving vehicle equipped
  with a nitro boost. Each pizza you deliver enables you to pick a new passenger with
  their own weapon, and you really can make a pretty wild ride.”<br>Gaming On Linux<br>"
