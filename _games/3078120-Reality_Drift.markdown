  /><br><br>Drive through a series of strange worlds, racing to be the first to deliver
  packages to obnoxious godlike creatures who have nothing but disdain for you. At
  the end of each track, choose between three options for a new track - you'll decide
  based on your stats and the linked upgrades being offered.<br><br><img class="bb_img"

  /><br><br>You'll start each race with a fixed set of stats for ACCEL, MAX SPEED
  and GRIP. Each time you're offered a choice for the next track, each option will
  be linked to a stat upgrade. Certain combinations will synergise with each other,
  or with your current stats! Sometimes, additional bonus upgrades such as Regen Braking,
  Shield, Antigrav and Foresight will be offered.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3078120/extras/stats.png?t=1733788078"

  /><br><br>Winning in Reality Drift is as much about making the right choices as
  how well you drive. Will you lean into ACCEL and MAX SPEED, or will you try to go
  for a GRIP build where you never have to slow down? Choices are made in real-time
  so you only have a few seconds to decide! In addition to the core stats, extra powerups
  are often available including REGEN BRAKING, SHIELD, ANTIGRAV, NAVIGATOR and FORESIGHT.
  The computer-controlled cars follow the same rules as you and choose which upgrades
  to obtain, but only you can choose what the next track will be.<br><br><img class="bb_img"

  /><br><br>As you win races you'll unlock a total of 25 missions, each with its own
  twist on the formula. Winning all races will unlock New Game+ where the difficulty
  will be raised and your mastery of the game will truly be tested!<br><br><img class="bb_img"
