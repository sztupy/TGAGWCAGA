  more than just survive...

  /><br><br><i>The world has ended.</i> ZERO Sievert charges you with scavenging equipment

  excursions into the wild. <br><br>Once you’re out in the wilds of the wasteland,
  however, the situation becomes a lot less secure. Across the five biomes of the
  game, you’ll initially be armed with little more than a gun and a bottle of water,
  after which point it’s up to you to recover items, take out bandits, and most importantly,
  get back alive. <br><br>And <strong>be warned</strong>; the nuclear fallout may
