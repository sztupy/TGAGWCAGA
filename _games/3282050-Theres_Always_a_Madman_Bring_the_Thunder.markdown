content_warning: {"ids":[2,5],"notes":"\"There's Always a Madman: Bring the Thunder\" is a spy thriller, so it does contain some references to violence in keeping with genre norms. However, such instances are equivalent to what would be found in a PG-13 rated film such as James Bond or Mission Impossible. These depictions of violence in \"There's Always a Madman: Bring the Thunder\" - though in line with similar spy thrillers - are presented in a tongue-in-cheek manner and are not meant to glorify them."}
