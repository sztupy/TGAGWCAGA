  /><br>Up to 3 friends can face relentless swarms of Tems together. Strategize, share
  resources(or don’t!), and take down increasingly more powerful bosses. Maximize
  your attack potential by coordinating gears and skills with precision timing, creating
  overpowered synergies. The ultimate test of teamwork and survival awaits!<br><br><img

  /><br>Conquer each stage by defeating challenging mini-bosses and formidable stage
  bosses with devastating abilities. Strategize, pivot, and prove your skills as you
  face off against powerful Tems like Gharunder, Yowlar, and Nessla. Only the boldest
  will emerge victorious - so gear up to defeat them and clear every hand-crafted
  stage before the swarm overwhelms you!<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2510960/extras/EN_GIF3.gif?t=1733326294"
  /><br>You have incredible power at your command. Choose when to tap into your Tem’s
  full potential and unleash devastating attacks, defensive abilities, or power-ups
  that help you and your friends clear the map in one fell swoop. With great power
  comes great responsibility...are you up to the task?<br><br><img class="bb_img"

  /><br>Adaptation is the key to surviving and your Tems are built for it! Collect
  XP after defeating enemies to level up, grow stronger, and unlock your final evolution.
  Each evolution brings massive power-ups to your skills and strength. Are you prepared
  to evolve and endure in this exciting adventure?<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2510960/extras/EN_GIF5.gif?t=1733326294"
  /><br>Collect and capture every available Tem to unlock their powerful Traits and
  unique Ultimate abilities. Experience the magic of every Tem and master them in
  both solo and co-op modes to rise to the challenge!<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2510960/extras/EN_GIF6.gif?t=1733326294"
  /><br>Getting pummeled by Oceara''s punishing attacks? No problem - when the going
  gets tough, the tough get going! Online co-op has Ghost Mode — Support your friends

  on in Ghost Mode!'
