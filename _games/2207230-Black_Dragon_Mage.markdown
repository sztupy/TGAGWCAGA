about: <strong>Black Dragon Mage</strong> is a gorgeous <strong>dark fantasy, action-roguelite,
  top-down shooter</strong> with elements from the <i>bullet heaven</i> subgenre (<i>aka
  &quot;survivors-like&quot;</i>), featuring 16 bit style retro visuals and <strong><i>thousands
  </i>of relentless demonic enemies</strong>, challenging <strong>boss fights</strong>
  and satisfying <strong>build variety</strong>.<h2 class="bb_tag">Become the Black
  Dragon Mage</h2><strong>Hatch your very own dragon companion</strong> from an egg

  /><br><br><strong>Upgrade your mage &amp; weapons</strong> on every level-up and
  pick a unique combination of <strong>ARPG-style abilities</strong> for your run.
  Every death is a new opportunity to experiment and grow your might! Buy new <strong>meta-upgrades</strong>
  (weapons, abilities, upgrades, hats &amp; more!) in the <i>Hall of Relics</i> and
  avenge your own death with newfound power.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2207230/extras/shred.gif?t=1733728717"
  /><br><br><strong>Grow your might!</strong> Launch increasingly large volleys of
  fireballs, or icy orbs that leave frosty mines and freeze foes on contact, blast
  the undead with your arcane beam staff or harness the dark and chaotic power of
  the void itself! All primary weapons can be modified through stats, or special upgrade
  paths called <i>Masteries</i>, to unlock their full strategic potential and build
  variety.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2207230/extras/overpowered.gif?t=1733728717"

  /><br><br><strong>Turn the environment to your favor</strong> using your <i>(often
  outrageously explosive!)</i> strategic genius, outmaneuver your foes by leading
  them into deadly traps! Laugh as you watch them hurl across the battlefield... <i>Fools!</i>
  Environments use procedural generation to make sure every run feels fresh, with
  randomly placed power-ups and hazards spread across the maps.
