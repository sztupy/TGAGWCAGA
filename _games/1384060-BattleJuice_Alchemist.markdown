  /><br><br><br><br>Juice, the alchemist, is called to Caribou Creek to fight the
  demons that roam the lands. As your unique version of Juice you explore the wilderness
  that once was New England. Fight evil in classic action RPG isometric top down view
  and in bullet-time close combat.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1384060/extras/SteamBannerAnimated2.gif?t=1730975583"
  /><br><br>Find and craft items with game-changing powers. Master BattleJuice Alchemist’s
  deck-building mechanics by arranging your compilation of flasks to suit your playstyle.
  Accentuate your character beyond character customization by using ritual magic as
  long-term buffs. Meet strange creatures from the Crossroads while the dark plot
  of BattleJuice Alchemist unravels.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1384060/extras/SteamBannerAnimated3.gif?t=1730975583"

  /><h2 class="bb_tag">UNIQUE ITEMS AND CHARACTER BUILDS</h2><br><i>Loot and Craft</i><br>As
  an alchemist you wear no armor and wield no sword, but you rain down fire on your
  enemies. Find flasks with unique properties in the wilderness or craft them at your
  workbench. In deck-building style you create a compilation of flasks which you randomly
  draw from.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1384060/extras/SteamBanner5.png?t=1730975583"
  /><br><br><i>Unique Skill System</i><br>In BattleJuice Alchemist, your flasks are
  your skills. Every flask can be used the normal way and at times in a supercharged,
  &quot;jucified&quot; way for stronger effects. Some flasks have powers attached
  to them that drastically change their effects when used, which allows you to develop
  your own playstyle.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1384060/extras/SeparatingLine.png?t=1730975583"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">EXPLORE A DARK WORLD</h2><br><i>Procedural Landscapes, Hand-crafted
  Towns</i><br>The world of BattleJuice Alchemist is separated into vast levels of
  procedural landscape. Every valley, sea, river, mountain, building, stone, tree
  and item is placed by a unique algorithm. This allows you to continue exploring
  after you completed the main story. Quest locations are still hand-crafted to tell
  compelling stories.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1384060/extras/SteamBannerAnimated4.gif?t=1730975583"
  /><br><br><i>Dark Lands to Discover</i><br>You are influenced by daytime and weather
  effects and so are your enemies. But they are also buffed by the evermore spawning
  demons’ presence. Find dark altars to hold their influence at bay and discover many
  other secrets.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1384060/extras/SeparatingLine.png?t=1730975583"
  /><h2 class="bb_tag">ENGAGING COMBAT</h2><br><i>Classic isometric ARPG action</i><br>Fight
  your enemies from afar in classic top down view. Throw explosive or freezing flasks
  at them, prepare ambushes of explosive barrels. Use the “Frog Hop” flask to jump
  away from danger or right into close combat.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1384060/extras/SteamBanner3.png?t=1730975583"
  /><br><br><i>Close Combat with Bullet-time</i><br>Enter close combat with an enemy,
  where you can interact hands on by dodging or using smoke flasks to avoid being
  hit. Manage your resources and flasks during these intense one on one battles against
  your awe-inspiring enemies from the Crossroads.<br><br>
