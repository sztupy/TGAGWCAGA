reviews: "“I honestly highly recommend it. It's got a lot out of what I like out of
  Brotato but presented in tower defense perspective, which I think is really clever,
  it's very strange but also neat.”<br>Wanderbots<br><br>“Are you feeling &quot;towerful&quot;
  today?”<br>Angory Tom<br><br>“It feels like my sword is getting longer.”<br>Retromation<br>"
