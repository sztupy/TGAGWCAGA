  notes: This game contains some smoking from one NPC
about: It's the early years of space exploration and a team has set out to find a
  lost Goldilocks planet, in hopes of being the first to find life outside of their
  own. However, plans were changed as the ship was hit by a solar flare, now crashing
  the ship, scattering the crew, and leaving them light-years from home. Luckily,
  they have Volt. She's the determined space engineer ready to put her athletic vixen
  grace to the test to get all the power and materials she needs to fix her ship and
  go home. <br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3066680/extras/open_gate.gif?t=1732917499"
  /><br><br>Inspired by many games of old, Solar Voltage brings the isometric platformer

  and learn more about the mysterious alien ruins that trap you.<br><br><img class="bb_img"
