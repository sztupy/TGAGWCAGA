title: A Simple Expurriment
description: 'A 2D platformer with puzzles, exploration and genetically modified cats.
  Help the cat mom search an alien ship for her missing kittens by doing typical,
  not-so-typical and definitely atypical cat things: run walls up and down, turn to
  liquid and rearrange parts of the ship like pieces of a puzzle.'
