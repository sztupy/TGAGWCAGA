  the Führer in this thrilling nazi-killing adventure. However, plans turn sour and

  Fash is a retro FPS throwback to the days of Wolfenstein where you take the role
  of Joan Marie, codename RED HYENA, in a mission to slaughter all the demonic nazis
  in Johannland and complete your mission of assassinating the Führer. With a pinch
  of the supernatural, the old-fashioned fascism, and the new-age modern political
  and technological world, you are set into a frenetic, action-packed nazi-killing
  romp where your skill is tested against the fascist armies.<br><br><img class="bb_img"

  /><br><br>The year is 2025. Johannland has overtaken nearly all of Western Europe
  under the Fourth Reich, and Johann Weiss, A.K.A Dark Weiss, rules Johannland with
  an iron fist on the fascist nation of Johannland, previously Germany and the rest
  of Europe. Thus the start of World War III, where the Johannland Axis faces the
  Allied forces in the looming threat of nuclear war.<br><br>Word also has it that
  Johannland is using some occult, demonic powers to keep rising to power. Their soldiers
  are turned into cosmic demons of sorts, who are savage, and brutal, and even engage
  in cannibalism and other sorts of brutal crimes. Some say it has something to do
  with an Elder God known as Azathoth, whose whereabouts are unknown but somehow his
  shard has possessed Dark Weiss to wield incredible powers which led him to rule
  Johannland.<br><br>SASS (Spies Against the Schutzstaffel) has dispatched their best
  agents for the infiltration and attack on Johannland. Including you, Joan Marie,
  codename RED HYENA, a proficient spy and secret agent with expertise in armed and
  unarmed combat and infiltration into enemy territory. Your mission was to infiltrate
  and assassinate Dark Weiss before nuclear tensions from the Axis rise up.<br><br>However,
  once you attempted to infiltrate Johannland’s heart of the nation, into the Neo-Reichstag,
  you have been accidentally caught by the suspecting guards, and captured by the
  Axis into the prison of Castle Johannstein, where you’ve been tortured and beaten
  in hopes the Neue-Schutzstaffel of Johannland could extract any information from
  you, without any success.<br><br>Luckily, your wits have led you to a plan for escape:
  you hide on the roof of your prison cell at Castle Johannstein when a guard checks
  inside. Once your prey has entered your cell, you quickly pounce on the guard and
  silently kill him with a kitchen knife you smuggled from your prison rations. You
  grab his pistol and set for escaping the castle, hoping you can continue with your
  mission of assassinating the Führer of Johannland.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2255380/extras/early_access_title.png?t=1687727234"
  /><br><br>This game is currently under Early Access and for now, it features only
  one single level. With the continued development of this game, we can hope to include
  afterwards the first full episode of the game, &quot;Escape from Castle Johannstein&quot;,
  and later on the rest of the campaign, as well as some other key features of the
  game. This is only a taste of what''s to come with the full game, as you''ll eventually
