  /><br>Anoxia Station is a mining management game set in a dystopian near-past. A
  supervolcanic eruption devastated the Earth’s surface, rendering it uninhabitable.
  Nations now teeter on the brink of extinction relying on the Terranauts - miners
  sent into the hellish depths of this dying world-. Their mission: extract petroleum,
  crucial to sustaining humanity''s essential infrastructures and survival.<br><br>It''s
  1988 and humanity fights on, as the Earth''s state deteriorates. Your crew is part
  of an international group of Terranauts sent to a demilitarized neutral zone. Heading
  into extreme depths and braving intense radiation, heat, and shifting rock, they
  discover an enormous abandoned mining station and information about a massive deposit
  of crude oil that could fuel humanity''s salvation.<br><br>But first they need to
  find the deposit. That means enduring conditions in the most inhospitable place
  known to man, while mining resources to support themselves and the remnants of mankind.
  The extraction must never halt, no matter the cost.  <br><br><img class="bb_img"

  /><br><strong>Mining Beyond the Extreme</strong><br>Your goal is to rip apart the
  dark depths of  Earth, producing resources to keep your workers alive and humanity
  surviving another day. Against you are extreme pressure, heat, radiation, and other
  incomprehensible dangers lurking deep beneath the decaying surface, across randomized
  maps that make every playthrough unique.<br><br>Every turn brings new challenges,
  forcing difficult decisions and careful consideration of circumstances. Every injury
  or death reduces the size of your crew permanently, while the pressure pulls them
  ever closer to the brink of snapping and endangering the whole station.<br><br>Each
  strip-mined and secured sector brings the entire crew closer to the fabled oil deposit.
  But the deeper you go, the more dangerous the environment becomes, bringing new
  dangers, new rules of survival, and new discoveries to make for the sake of mankind.<br><br><img

  the surface.<br><br>Choose the leader of the mining station and their crews. The
