  /><h2 class="bb_tag"></h2>Virtue’s Heaven is an expressive, 2D action metroidvania.
  Explore a dense, interconnected space that claims to be the last bastion of humanity
  in a dying world. Break through its walls, liberate your friends and uncover the
  curse that lies at the heart of humanity’s biggest failure.<br><strong></strong><br><strong></strong><h2
  class="bb_tag">Features</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Expressive Movement:</strong>
  You start Virtue''s Heaven with a moveset that other metroidvanias have at the end.
  There is no need for a special jacket that lets you dash, or shoes for double-jumping.
  You alone are enough to perform these actions.<br></li><li><strong>Aggressive, Fast
  Paced Combat: </strong>Your body is your weapon in Virtue’s Heaven. Whether you
  run, jump, dash, slide, or double jump, every move can be used to attack your enemies.
  <br></li><li><strong>Hunt your Bosses:</strong> Collect the heads of those that
  rule Virtue’s Heaven to reach new areas and use their hearts to become even more
  powerful.<br></li><li><strong>Hug your Friends:</strong> It powers you up! It''s
  also just a nice thing to do.<br></li><li><strong>Customizable Power-Ups:</strong>
  Equip your friend''s convictions to gain access to powerful attacks and abilities.<br></li><li><strong>A

  but that doesn’t mean that your actions until then won’t matter.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"></h2><h2
  class="bb_tag">Be Beautiful</h2>Virtue’s Heaven wants you to destroy the world and
  look amazing in the process. Launch yourself into your enemies, then turn around
  and kick them in the face. Grab their exploding remains and hurl them into your
  next opponent. Your body might be the only weapon you have, but you will find it
  to be more versatile than any sword, gun or spear could ever be.<h2 class="bb_tag">Be
  Reckless</h2>Dying in Virtue’s Heaven might set you back a bit, but each time you
  fail, you leave something behind that will help you push forward, should you be
  able to get there again. <br>Never be afraid of failure, instead fling yourself
  right into its face and punch it as hard as you can.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Power
  of Friendship</h2>You’re not going to venture into Virtue’s Heaven on your own.
  The convictions of your friends will accompany you and give you the ability to break
  the world itself.<h2 class="bb_tag"></h2><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1929860/extras/virthavnulaser.gif?t=1733746674"
