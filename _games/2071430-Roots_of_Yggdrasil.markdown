reviews: "“Roots of Yggdrasil is a good spin on the roguelike genre, and one that
  should appeal to those who typically shy away from its trappings. It’s combination
  of city-building and card-based deckbuilding make it both inviting and forgiving,
  while remaining challenging.”<br>8/10 – Gaming Nexus<br><br>“Roots of Yggdrasil
  is a refreshing and engaging gaming experience that brilliantly combines elements
  of strategy, management, and roguelike.”<br>7.5/10 – BetaTesteur<br><br>“Roots of
  Yggdrasil is a very intuitive and addictive game. It hits the perfect balance of
  challenging but rewarding.”<br>8.4/10 – Screen Hype<br>"
