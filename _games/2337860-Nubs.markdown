reviews: "“Nubs aims to deliver fast-paced, arena-based battles for up to four players,
  fighting in chaotic brawls using quirk-based characters, daft weapons, and lethal
  traps–and it looks pretty damn great.”<br>Forbes<br><br>“Nubs! is a multiplayer
  brawler. Not like Smash Bros, mind you. Looking at it, it reminds me of The Legend
  of Zelda: Four Swords.”<br>Destructoid<br><br>“Awesomenauts devs reclaim their unfinished
  game as new studio Rangatang”<br>GamesIndustry<br>"
