description: Slap yourself into the absurdity of Nubs, where 5-player battles are
  as chaotic as they are quick! Risk it all for the mighty Konzumos' delight in this
  arena brawler and smash the others to nublivion in your quest for glory! Simple
  rules? Check. Roguelite progression? Sure. Predictability? No way!

reviews: "“Nubs aims to deliver fast-paced, arena-based battles for up to four players,
  fighting in chaotic brawls using quirk-based characters, daft weapons, and lethal
  traps–and it looks pretty damn great.”<br>Forbes<br><br>“Nubs! is a multiplayer
  brawler. Not like Smash Bros, mind you. Looking at it, it reminds me of The Legend
  of Zelda: Four Swords.”<br>Destructoid<br><br>“Awesomenauts devs reclaim their unfinished
  game as new studio Rangatang”<br>GamesIndustry<br>"
