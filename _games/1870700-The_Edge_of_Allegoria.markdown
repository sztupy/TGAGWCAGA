  /><br>Do you like adventure? Are you a sucker for a world of monsters and magic?<br>Do
  you like wholesale violence peppered with coarse language, and served with a side

  that Allegoria has in store.<br>Harvest the body parts of your adversaries for financial
  gain and personal satisfaction, level up to strike down even greater foes, and arm
  yourself with more weapons and equipment than any sane person could be reasonably
  expected to carry on their person at any given time.<br><br><img class="bb_img"

  /><br>There are more than 144 unique enemies to face on your adventures through
  Allegoria, from ferocious Canadian geese and majestic tortoises to your bog-standard
  fantasy staples like dragons, unicorns, and the ever-ubiquitous slimes! There are
  plenty of beasts and beyond to encounter, each with unique item drops that can be
  sold in shops for the gold you'll need to purchase weapons and equipment to aid
  you on your journey.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1870700/extras/manticore_quake.gif?t=1733687338"

  /><br>Have you ever played a game that has one weapon you just can't put down, or
  an armor set that makes you indestructible? It's a great feeling, isn't it?<br>Too
  bad that's not the case here.<br>In Allegoria, if you want to get stronger, you'll
  need to master as much equipment as you can if you want to increase your stats,
  and if you think you need new attacks or magic spells to bring with you into battle,
  you'd better replace that old gear with something new, and fast. With more than
  80 skills to learn and almost 150 pieces of equipment to collect, you'll want to
  try them all to find the right move set for you!<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1870700/extras/weapon_inventory.gif?t=1733687338"

  /><br>There's no shortage of personality in Allegoria, and everyone seems to have
  something to say. Most of it's just fluff to fill in empty spaces and make the world
  seem more lifelike, but every once in a while, someone actually has something useful
  to say.<br>They may be a little rough around the edges, but the people of Allegoria
  are always willing to guide you on your journey, and they might even have a quest
  or two for you to earn gold and other helpful items.<br><br><img class="bb_img"

  /><br>There's a story in there somewhere... it's just buried under layers of madness
  and debauchery.<br>If you think grinding for experience and mastering weapons is
  tedious, try to unravel this Gordian knot of a narrative.<br>Does it have a deeper
  meaning? Absolutely!<br>Does it matter? No! It's a video game! Just enjoy it and
  stop worrying about what kind of subliminal messaging the developer is trying to
  inject into your subconscious...<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1870700/extras/opening_-_wyldelennon.gif?t=1733687338"
