  in melee combat with a sword. It can leap into the air and crash down on groups

  wherever desired. The Defender is sturdy and can construct solid stone walls. </p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph"><strong>The Engineer</strong>: Your Kritter fights here at
  mid-range with a flamethrower. A true war machine, the Engineer also shoots sharp
  nuts around him. It can place turrets that automatically target your opponents.
  The Engineer is more fragile than its counterparts but more destructive. </p></li><li><p
  class="bb_paragraph"><strong>The Tracker</strong>: Your Kritter wields a sniper
  rifle here; the Tracker can take down targets from kilometers away. It also has
  a mortar shot for area damage and can place mines along its path to greet those
  foolish enough to follow. The Tracker creates barriers that its shots can pass through.

  />Despite your efforts, it''s highly likely that defeat will occur at some point.
  M.Ark will then rewind time, bringing you back to its cockpit, and everything will
  need to be done again... Well, almost everything! You''ll be able to upgrade your
  Kritter or M.Ark between games using soul crystals! These major upgrades will make
  life easier for you: adding a shield around M.Ark, adding a radar to know where
