title: Yet Another Zombie Survivors
description: The Horde is coming but you're ready to fight it! Assemble your team
  and decide upon their enhancements to find the most efficient synergies against
  thousands of the undead. Survive. Then evolve. Then break all the limits in this
  deceivingly simple but addictive reverse bullet hell.

  zombie horde pay for their unholy existence. The virus has spread throughout the

  controls or hour-long cutscenes — jump right into the fray and watch the fireworks!
  It's a game that everyone will enjoy, no matter their gaming experience, as the
