reviews: "“It makes for a very compelling, one-more-battle type of feeling that I
  haven't gotten from a strategy RPG in a good long while.”<br>Titanium Legman<br><br>“The
  myriad of different ways the game allows you to interact with and manipulate the
  terrain is absolutely brilliant. It adds a layer of depth to the genre that is absolutely
  mind-blowing.”<br>Adam the Fanatic<br><br>“[W]hile we already know the tactical
  layer is solid titanium, it’s the building on character growth and interplay that
  produces wildly differing experiences from player to player, play through to play
  through.”<br>PressPlayGaming<br>"
