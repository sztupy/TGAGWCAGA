title: 1cm Time
description: Explore, adventure, collect, and experience anecdotes and various interesting
  characters in a city-based 3D RPG, discovering some beautiful little worlds. Or
  perhaps wander aimlessly on the streets, relaxing in the shade of trees. Such a
  wonderful time is not far away.
