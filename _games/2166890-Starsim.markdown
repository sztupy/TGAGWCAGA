about: <p class="bb_paragraph">Starsim is a sci-fi multi-genre (pausable real-time,
  text quest, turn-based tactics) computer game where you can be anyone.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Players
  explore a partially randomly generated galaxy, with each sector containing multiple
  stars and planets. This results in a universe of hundreds of planets, each with
  its own economy, government and opinion of the player.<br> <br><img class="bb_img"

  /></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The game is not limited by borders and allows players
  to influence the branching storyline. At the same time, the larger and more expansive
  game world lives and evolves on its own. In Starsim, players will have the opportunity
  to test their skills not only in space, but also in turn-based tactics. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">One
  of the game's features is the simulation of ship control, including crew management,
  ship modification and control of systems such as weapons, engines and shields. <br>
