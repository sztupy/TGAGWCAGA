Unlock new crops as you progress, from crispy carrots to ripe tomatoes. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Produce biofuel:</strong> <br>Use crops to produce clean and energy-efficient biofuel, a vital robot power source. Sell biofuel to other machine inhabitants and reinvest the money into expanding your farm. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Automate with robots:</strong> <br>Deploy a team of cute little robots to assist with planting, watering, and harvesting. Customize and upgrade your helper bots to increase efficiency. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2666510/extras/close-up.gif?t=1732609935\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Multitasking:</strong> <br>Rusty's Retirement is built to sit comfortably at the bottom of your screen allowing you to do other tasks while caring for your farm. Zoom in or out for a less distracting view, or alternatively turn on 'Focus Mode' which slows down crop production. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Vertical mode:</strong> <br>You can also create a new vertical farm that sits comfortably at the side of your screen. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Twitch Integration available:</strong> <br>Streamers and viewers can build a farm together. Viewers can control what task their robot should focus on through chat commands like !plant !water !harvest.  </p>"
