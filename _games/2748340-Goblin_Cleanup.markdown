  /><br><br>Have you ever wondered what happens after completing a dungeon, how it
  is restarted or, better yet, who is in charge of doing it? In Goblin Cleanup, you
  assume the role of a professional cleaner hired by the dungeon manager to clean
  and prepare the dungeon for the next adventure. You can perform this task alone
  or with up to three companions, cooperatively or maybe not so cooperatively!<br><br><br><img

  /><br><br><br>Be careful because the dungeons are dark and full of terrors, although
  as a professional cleaner this is not a problem, just don't step on a trap, and
  keep the monsters fed, you don't want them to eat you, or any of your friends.<br><br><img

  /><br><br>You can clean the dungeons with three more employees, just watch what
  they do, because if they die you will have to clean their pieces and blood, the
  heroes already leave everything very dirty to make things worse.<br>Clean the dungeons
  in cooperative games for 4 players online.<h2 class="bb_tag"> Key Features</h2>
