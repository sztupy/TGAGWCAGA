about: 'Becoming Saint places you in the shoes of a young woman from Assissi, Italy
  in the 14th century, determined to preach, inspire and convert others!<br>Harness
  the religious fervor of your followers to conquer and convert as many city-states
  as possible, paving your way to sainthood. However, there are many obstacles to
  success, but with perseverance you will <strong>Become a Saint during your lifetime!</strong><h2
  class="bb_tag">Engage in Real-time medieval battles </h2>Engage in small-scale battles
  with select units making each choice strategic (unit synergies, strengths, weaknesses,
  blessings...) and allowing you to appreciate all the meticulously implemented details
  of each battle. The stakes of battle are not through the deaths of your enemies
  but the conversion of their settlements – because sainthood is not achieved through
  senseless violence.<br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2643010/extras/battle-setup-GIF.gif?t=1733735430"
