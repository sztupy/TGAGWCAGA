reviews: "“The playful surrealness of its lighthearted musical adventure thus gives
  way to nightmarish logic and eventually outright horror.”<br>8 – Edge<br><br>“It’s
  hard to really figure out what Starstruck: Hands of Time is about based on trailers
  or screenshots.”<br>8.5 – Destructoid<br><br>“Only after playing through the whole
  game will you realize that Starstruck is a philosophical work that uses cross-dimensional
  rhetoric to explain the importance of maintaining your identity, both in art and
  life.”<br>indienova<br>"
