title: "Quantum Witch"
description: "Wake up lovely, you've got things to do! First, find your lost flock of faer. Then find your wife, she'd look so cute wearing that flower you found. And if you have time, attack and dethrone god. Ok? Don't worry about that portal. I'm sure it's nothing. Now be careful. Every choice matters."

detailed_description: "<strong>It's a straightforwardly lovely day in Hus.</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3100650/extras/bovey.gif?t=1729869745\" /><br><br>It's <i>always</i> a lovely day in Hus. That's not suspicious at all! The bovey is grazing in the field, the faer are roaming around town causing chaos, the shadies are out preaching (they're not a cult!), and a giant stone portal to another dimension has appeared in the woods.<br><br>I hope nothing goes hideously wrong and results in an adventure.<br><br><strong>So what is it?</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Narrative and choice driven platform adventure. Imagine choose your own adventure meets point and click meets platformer. Yes, you've got it! It's that. Not a platformer: a PLOTformer<br></li><li>Hand crafted retro resolution pixel art in a cute style that definitely doesn't unexpectedly turn creepy.<br></li><li>Not a cult.<br></li><li>Choices matter. Convince a character to wear something? They'll wear it for the rest of the game. Save a character? They'll be there as part of your story.</li></ul><br>This is the journey of Ren, a twenty-something shepardess who gets thrown into a multiversal conflict while on a fetch quest to find her lost flock. She'll have the fates of her friends in her hands, and YOU will have to help her make the difficult choices.<br><br>Will she prevail? Will anyone survive? Why does everything pseudo-mystic have Quantum in the title? These questions and more, or fewer, may or may not be answered!<br><br>Characters and story original creations of NikkiJay, developed with BAFTA nominated writer Paul Rose.<br><br>Also you can pet the kitty.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What people are saying</h2><br>&quot;Instead of laying on the exposition and world building, we as the player are dropped into a world that feels lived in. Especially with a romantic relationship, instead of grabbing us by the throat and telling us that character X &amp; Y care for each other and you should care too! They are just a couple, but get past that and they have layers.&quot; - Scott's Game Asylum.<br><br>&quot;As a fan of narrative driven games, let me tell you, I am loving this.&quot; - Drewlusion, variety streamer.<br><br>&quot;A bunch of woke nonsense. It's got women in it!&quot; - Internet Man"
