  notes: The game takes place in a fictional world with two antagonist nations. It
    explores how each nation's intelligence agency subverts the use of social media
    to influence public opinion both domestically and in the other nation. It covers
    such themes as malicious use of hate speech and incitement of conflicts for political
    gain.
