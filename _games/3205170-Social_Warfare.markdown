Endorsing multiple identities, you will shape public opinion through comments on social media. You will promote loyalty in the Great Kingdom of Eternia while disrupting society in its arch-enemy, the Federation of the Free.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each mission is a news item where, using a terminal that enables you to take multiple online identities, you select comments/replies that fit your objectives. A mood meter gives you real-time feedback on the public’s reaction: you win when it goes totally to the right side, and lose when it goes totally to the wrong side.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game will then switch sides and put you in the Federation of the Free's Social Intelligence Task Force, where you will fight against what you were promoting. Through a list of news items that covers a range of political and social matters, you will alternately promote two opposing viewpoints.<br><br>Social Media is your weapon, public opinion your battelfield!</p>"
