  /><br><br>Our android starts his mission as a nameless, remote-controlled worker.
  He is supposed to collect information about a planet for his builders, the goal

  to an accident the remote control breaks and the android is able to make free decisions.
  Now he is no longer an empty shell for AC-0209, but its partner, which the AI absolutely
  does not please. Especially since the AI has no body of its own and is carried around
  by the android in a &quot;multifunctional tool&quot;.  <br>Now they try to complete
  the mission despite the adverse circumstances.<br><br>On his journey, the android
  encounters bizarre creatures such as moth cats, broccoli animals, flying stream
  rays, gigantic tentacle plants and other AIs that have remained on the planet for
  centuries without a task or purpose, which has made them, well, possibly a bit strange.
  <br><br>Little by little, the android learns about the history of the planet and
  its builders, and what it would mean if they were to take possession of it again.
