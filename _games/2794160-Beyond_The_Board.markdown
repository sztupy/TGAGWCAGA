  /><br>Go &quot;Beyond the Board&quot; in this single player puzzle game that transforms
  traditional chess into a minimal immersive journey. As you explore this land of
  shifting tiles, you’ll encounter new mysterious, and powerful pieces. Challenge
  your strategic skills and explore the shattered dimensions of chess. <br><br><i>Can
  you master all the challenges that lie beyond this board? </i><br> <br><br><img

  /><br>During a chess match, a mysterious lightning strike disrupts the game, shattering
  the board and sending the pieces into unknown depths. Left with only a single Rook,
  you must chase the enemy King through this new three-dimensional chess realm, in
  order to seek answers and the rest of your party. <br><br><br><img class="bb_img"

  /><br>In this chess journey, each level features puzzles that incorporate standard
  checkmate strategies but with new rules and conditions, requiring players to think
  outside the box. The game also includes switches that trigger moving blocks, creating
  more complex and dynamic levels, and making the environment feel more alive.<br><br><br><img

  /><br>In this world, you'll face many enemy pieces with unique curses, such as the
  &quot;Dodge Curse.&quot; To defeat these cursed pieces, you must understand their
  behavior and outplay them. At the end of each chess kingdom, you must face a Boss
  piece. These tough challenges, once conquered, will reveal more secrets about the
  world beyond the board.<br><br><br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2794160/extras/Replay.gif?t=1731027979"

  /><br>Levels feature hidden paths, similar to Metroidvanias, which become accessible
  as you unlock specific pieces and expand your party. The level selector enhances
  replayability by allowing you to revisit each level and kingdom with different combinations
  of pieces. This means you can replay old levels with new paths and puzzle solutions.<br><br><br><br><img

  us in bringing to life this world of shifting tiles and mind-bending puzzles!
