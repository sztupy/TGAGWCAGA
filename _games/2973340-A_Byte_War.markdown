  /><br>A Byte War is a real time strategy game where you lead a race of block-based
  machines against a machine threat from another dimension. Build your base up from
  blocks, form patterns and construct buildings to cover your needs: resource harvesting,
  unit spawning, influence spreading and more. Find your own path in missions that
  allow for various endings, from conquering the enemy, expanding your influence to
  conquer the map or stand your ground and don''t allow the enemy to breach your defenses.<br><br><img

  /><br>A Byte war provides you with the ability to build your basic building block:
  a block. Build it up into patterns on a tile-based grid and form buildings with
  a specific shape and functionalities. Use their specific shapes to position them
  like puzzle pieces and form your own base as you imagine.<br><br>Each building is
  controlled by controls on top of it. For example:<br>- HQ, your main building with
  controls for specific active skills.<br>- Resource harvester with controls for spawning
  and automatic harvesting.<br>- Unit spawner with a control to send your units to
  a specific destination<br><br>Constructing these essential buildings requires arranging
  blocks into specific patterns. Unlock new patterns and building capabilities as
  you progress through challenging missions, each introducing unique functionalities
  that enhance your strategic options.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2973340/extras/Convert_the_world.png?t=1731054221"

  /><br>Expanding your influence is one of the crucial mechanics to take over the
  area around you. Your influence starts with your HQ, which generates a permanent
  spot of influence, to continue extending your reach strategically place influence
  spreaders, amplifying your control over the surrounding area.<br><br>Areas under
  your influence come with significant advantages:<br>- Keep your base up and running<br>-
  Heal your damaged units.<br>- Weaponize it to disable enemy buildings and damage
  enemy units<br>- Generate new resource deposits<br>- Convert existing ones on the
  map<br><br>Watch out however, as your enemy can use their influence to counter yours.<br><br><img

  /><br>Choose your own path with every mission that shapes your unique journey and
  outcome.<br><br>The game offers a variety of mission types, each presenting distinct
  challenges and strategic objectives. You''ll find yourself running away from overwhelming
  enemy forces, holding off relentless invasions to survive, conquering enemy territories
