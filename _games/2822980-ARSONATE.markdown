reviews: "“The theming is delightful here and sets it apart from being a simple card-based
  strategy game.”<br>Demo Disk Review<br><br>“If you're a fan of Buckshot Roulette
  and just love its adrenaline-fueled, unpredictable gameplay that blends chance and
  strategy, you're sure to enjoy the strategic battle in ARSONATE, a unique first-person
  card-based strategy game that draws inspiration from Buckshot Roulette.”<br>80 Level<br><br>“Utilities
  are executed with pleasing literalness: I have yet to win any real-life cardgames
  by embedding a fireaxe in the table, but I'm keen to try it during my next round
  of Cosmic Encounters.”<br>Rock Paper Shotgun<br>"
