  navigating through dialogues you can find yourself in complex <strong>puzzles</strong>,

  much more. Taking inspiration from classic TTRPGs, we created <strong>a dynamic
  dialogue system</strong> that leaves room for unpredictable branching, with <strong>gameplay

  to the <strong>Cunning</strong> <strong>mechanic</strong>, which allows new lines

  a contemporary take on it. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2244700/extras/GlasshouseGIF_Axe-rounded.gif?t=1733315939"

  />Glasshouse''s is <strong>a fragmented and deglobalized post-capitalist world</strong>.
  Following the Rifle Strike of 1828, states and nations were torn down in favor of
  a <strong>feudal geopolitical structure</strong>. This sudden denationalization
  resulted in severe <strong>immobility in terms of technological progress</strong>,
  which over the next 200 years fostered a great economic divide between what are
  called <strong>Productive Fiefdoms</strong> and <strong>Sterile Fiefdoms</strong>.
  <br><br>In 2028, the CoFoPo union, a coalition made up of more than 52 Sterile Fiefdoms,
  declares war on the status quo, with the goal of <strong>reunifying the globe under
  the banner of capitalism</strong>.<br>     <br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2244700/extras/GH_Splash-rounded.gif?t=1733315939"

  interactions</strong>. Through what we call the <strong>“Interaction Tab,”</strong>
  navigating through dialogues you can find yourself in complex <strong>puzzles</strong>,
  <strong>Quick Time Events</strong>, items to collect,  secret hiding places and
  much more. Taking inspiration from classic TTRPGs, we created <strong>a dynamic
  dialogue system</strong> that leaves room for unpredictable branching, with <strong>gameplay
  always at the center</strong>.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img

  /></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Each dialogue can hide unexpected interactions thanks
  to the <strong>Cunning</strong> <strong>mechanic</strong>, which allows new lines
  of dialogue to be unlocked when certain items are present in your inventory. Dialogue
  is at the heart of any good CRPG worth its salt, and Glasshouse honors it through
  a contemporary take on it. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2244700/extras/GlasshouseGIF_Axe-rounded.gif?t=1733315939"

  />Glasshouse''s is <strong>a fragmented and deglobalized post-capitalist world</strong>.
  Following the Rifle Strike of 1828, states and nations were torn down in favor of
  a <strong>feudal geopolitical structure</strong>. This sudden denationalization
  resulted in severe <strong>immobility in terms of technological progress</strong>,
  which over the next 200 years fostered a great economic divide between what are
  called <strong>Productive Fiefdoms</strong> and <strong>Sterile Fiefdoms</strong>.
  <br><br>In 2028, the CoFoPo union, a coalition made up of more than 52 Sterile Fiefdoms,
  declares war on the status quo, with the goal of <strong>reunifying the globe under
  the banner of capitalism</strong>.<br>     <br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2244700/extras/GH_Splash-rounded.gif?t=1733315939"
