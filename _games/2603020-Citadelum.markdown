detailed_description: "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Defy the Gods of the Pantheon or follow their will. Become the master of oh so many lives and destiny of so few in this twist to the genre face to face with the old deities.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2603020/extras/01_citadelum.gif?t=1732016813\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Build your settlement.</strong> Gather and refine resources from forests and quarries, breed animals, grow vegetables, fish and make wine, so you can keep your population healthy and fed. Improve your buildings and ensure water supply with aqueducts. Welcome citizens to your village as artisans, farmers, carpenters... or train them to join your legions in different units. Towers and walls will protect your village from barbarian attacks, while it grows into a magnificent city.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2603020/extras/02_citadelum.gif?t=1732016813\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Expand.</strong> Explore the world map, free villages under siege and experience the power of the most advanced armies of the era: the legion, engaging in tactical auto-battle combat. Once the territory is secured, you can set trade routes, import exotic resources and scale up your economy. Send out your explorers to find a collection of mythological objects that will help you in your expansion and complete missions for the Senate.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2603020/extras/03b_citadelum.gif?t=1732016813\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Honour.</strong> Rise to the pantheon and gain the favor of the gods. Build temples, make offerings so they will grant you gifts. But beware, because gods behave in a capricious and ruthless manner; worship one of them and you may suffer the wrath of another. Interaction with deities allows a non linear, replayable narrative, full of mythical encounters. Prepare to be amazed when they come down to earth and help you, or tremble with fear if they punish your people. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2603020/extras/04_citadelum.gif?t=1732016813\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>City Building, evolved.</strong> Citadelum presents a unique three layered gameplay, based in city building core mechanics, strategic expansion and commerce, and the role of the gods. You will find different missions, artifacts and challenges in every playthrough.</p>"
