detailed_description: "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When the phone rings in the Feline Forensics department, that can only mean one thing... it's time to get your toe beans dirty. In this short, soft-boiled detective puzzler, you assume the role of a crime-crushing noir tabby who's all out of catnip. With numerous layers of intrigue and conspiracy, you'll have to rely on sharp senses and your wisest whisker to uncover the truth of this meowseum mystery.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945150/extras/artifact2.gif?t=1730679801\" />Famously known as the museum's most valuable exhibit, the gemstone's true worth is beyond kitten comprehension.... and now its missing. How did the criminals thwart the alarm system? How did they subvert the lockdown? Rely on deductive reasoning skills to prove that there's no such thing as a purrfect crime.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945150/extras/innocent2.gif?t=1730679801\" />While it's no surprise that someone would scheme such an intricate heist, mismatched alibis and mistrusting motivations provide little explanation as to how it devolved into a grizzly murder. With such a strange cast of suspects, no one is above a carnivorous suspicion, so converse with, and cross-examine them all. Could it be the true crime podcasting koala? How about a pig tourist with a torrid past? The snooty schnauzer of another generation?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945150/extras/reputation2.gif?t=1730679801\" />A failed investigation could mean that terrible criminals walk free, and a once-thriving museum will finally bite the dust. The uniquely hand-drawn style of its many displays would be forced to auction. The whimsical yet haunting atmosphere of the museum building itself could be abandoned, or worse... turned into a retail electronics store. The jazz soundtrack, composed of saxophones, plunger trumpets, and speakeasy pianos, would slowly fall into forgotten memory.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945150/extras/puns2.gif?t=1730679801\" />This is both a feature, and a warning. There are just far too many cat puns... actually, no pun is off-limits. Its honestly an excessive use of groan-worthy humor.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Additional Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A conspiracy board (without red string, it would be too distracting)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">An evidence journal (yes, the detective can hold a pencil)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Text speed settings (for cautiously slow to suspiciously quick players)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Silly interpretations of famous artwork (parody law please protect us)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A cat (wearing a full suit and tie)</p></li></ul>"
