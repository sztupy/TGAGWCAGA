title: Antisuns
description: Antisuns is a tactical RPG set in the far future. Command your crew in
  turn-based combat across multiple spaceships. See enemy moves ahead of time, and
  come up with the perfect response. Push your luck for greater rewards. If you fail,
  go back in time, for another randomly-generated run.
