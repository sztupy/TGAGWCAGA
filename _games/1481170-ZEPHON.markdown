  4X. ZEPHON is a post-apocalyptic hellscape - bursting at the seams with sentient
  mechs, mutated beasts, and void horrors. From your first turns to your last - you
  will be fighting to survive.”<br>GINX TV<br><br>“Civilization 6’s in-depth strategy
  and Frostpunk’s brutal vision of the apocalypse have a rival in a new 4X game. Between
  combat, construction, research, and narrative, Zephon has a unique interpretation
  of all the strategy sim staples.”<br>PCGamesN<br>"
