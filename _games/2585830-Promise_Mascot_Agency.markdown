reviews: "“The vibe here lands somewhere between Yakuza and Deadly Premonition—a statement
  I hope will serve as an activation phrase for at least a dozen weirdos.”<br>Lincoln
  Carpenter, PC Gamer<br><br>“Promise Mascot Agency is the videogame singularity.
  It contains all good things about all videogames and once it’s out, I will not need
  to ever play another videogame again.”<br>Nic Reuben, Rock Paper Shotgun<br><br>“You
  probably could have struck my interest with “from the developers of Paradise Killer,”
  but the trailer delivers beyond that with just a feverish representation of Japan.
  Damn, I’m excited.”<br>Zoey Handley, Destructoid<br>"
