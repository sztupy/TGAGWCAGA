  /><br><br>Create and care for your unique ecosystem, filled with animals like rabbits

  grow and reap greater rewards over time! Use leafpoints to buy new animals and aquire
  upgrades such as enhancing the quality and quantity of food you can spawn in your
  ecosystem.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2950400/extras/61b15100a8388919f9f6acd8a0357f5d2-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?t=1725716889"

  /><br><br>Advance through levels by unlocking special chests with your leafpoints.
  Each chest contains a unique companion with special abilities to help you maintain
  your ecosystem. Strategize with up to three companions per level to maximize efficiency.

  leafpoint bonuses.<br><br><img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2950400/extras/ezgif-3-22eee66be5.gif?t=1725716889"

  /><br><br>Protect your ecosystem from invading monsters emerging from portals. Each
